\begin{definition}[$k$-core~\cite{md1983,kcore2003}]
\label{def:kcore}
Given an integer $k$ ($k\geq 0$), the $k$-core of $G$,
denoted by $H_{k}$, is the largest subgraph of $G$, such that $\forall v \in H_k$, $deg_{H_k}(v) \geq k$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Induced rooted subtree]
Given two P-trees $T$ and $S$ rooted at $r_t$ and $r_s$. $T$ is the induced rooted subtree of $S$ iff there exist a one-to-one mapping $\varphi$: $V_s \to V_t$ and $l$ denotes the label of tree node $x$, three constraints hold:

\vspace{1ex}

$\bullet$ $\varphi(r_s)=r_t$;

$\bullet$ $\forall x \in V_s$, $l(x)=l(\varphi(x))$;

$\bullet$ $\forall (x,y) \in E_s$, $(\varphi(x),\varphi(y)) \in E_t$. 
\end{definition}

{\it Inuduced rooted subtree} preserves the parent-child relationships as well as corresponding labels. In addition, the root node of the trees must be preserved. Unless otherwise specified, all uses of the term ``subtree'' refer to ``induced rooted subtree''. P-trees $T$ and $S$ are {\it isomorphic} iff $T$ is the subtree of $S$ and $S$ is the subtree of $T$ simultaneously.


\begin{definition}[Maximum common subtree]
Given a graph $G$, $D$ is a P-tree database which pairs with vertices in $G$. $T$ is the common subtree of $D$ such that $\forall t \in D$, $T$ is the subtree of $t$. Furthermore, $T$ is the maximum common subtree of $D$ (denoted as $\Gamma(G)$) if there exists no other common subtree $T'$ such that $T$ is the subtree of $T'$. 

%Given a graph $G_{\sigma}$, $D_{\sigma}$ is a P-tree database which pairs with vertices in $G_{\sigma}$. $|D_{\sigma}|=\sigma$. 
%T$ is the maximum $\sigma$-common subtree in $G_{\sigma}$ iff $\forall t \in D_{\sigma}$, $T$ is the subtree of $t$ and there exists no other common subtree $T'$ in $D_{\sigma}$ such that $T$ is the subtree of $T'$.
\end{definition}



\begin{problem}[PCQ]
\label{PCQ}
Given a profiled graph $G(V,E)$, a profile tree $T$, a positive integer $k$, and one query node $q\in G$, find a set $\mathcal {G}$ of graphs, such that $\forall G_q \in \mathcal {G}$, the following properties hold:

\vspace{1ex}

$\bullet$ \textbf{Connectivity cohesiveness}. (1)$G_q \subseteq G$ is connected and contains $q$, (2)$\forall v\in G_q$, $deg_{G_q}(v)\geq k$;

$\bullet$ \textbf{Maximal structure}. There exists no other $\tilde G_q$ satisfying \textbf {connectivity cohesiveness} such that $G_q \subset \tilde G_q$ if $\Gamma(G_q)$ and $\Gamma(\tilde G_q)$ are isomorphic;

$\bullet$ \textbf{Semantic cohesiveness}. There exists no other $\tilde G_q$ satisfying \textbf {connectivity cohesiveness}, such that $\Gamma(G_q)$ is the subtree of $\Gamma(\tilde G_q)$.
