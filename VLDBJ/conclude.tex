\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusion}

An AC is a community that exhibits structure and keyword cohesiveness. To facilitate ACQ evaluation, we develop the CL-tree index and its query algorithms. We further propose index maintenance algorithms for dynamic graphs.
Moreover, we formally define ACQ-A and ACQ-M problems and propose efficient query algorithms based on the CL-tree index.
Our experimental results on several dataseats show that ACs are easier to interpret than those of existing community detection/search methods, and they can be ``personalized''. In addition, our solutions are also faster than existing community search algorithms.

In the future, we will study the use of other measures of structure cohesiveness (e.g., $k$-truss, $k$-clique) and keyword cohesiveness (e.g., Jaccard similarity and string edit distance) in the ACQ definition.
We will also investigate how the directions of edges will affect the formation of an AC.
We will examine how graph pattern matching techniques \cite{GPM-KDD2007,GPM-VLDB2010,GPM-PVLDB2015} can be extended to find ACs effectively from large attributed graphs. An interesting research direction is to study how to automatically generate a meaningful graph pattern that well reflects a real community, and how to use these patterns to find ACs efficiently.
