\section{CL-tree Index}
\label{index}
The major limitation of {\tt basic-g} and {\tt basic-w} is that
they need to find the $k$-$\widehat {core}$s and do keyword filtering repeatedly.
This makes the community search very inefficient.
To achieve higher query efficiency, we propose a novel index,
called \textbf{CL-tree} (\underline{C}ore \underline{L}abel tree),
which organizes both the $k$-$\widehat {core}$s and keywords into a tree structure.
Based on the index, the efficiency of answering ACQ and its variants
can be improved significantly.
We first introduce the index in Section~\ref{indexIntro},
and then propose two index construction methods in Section~\ref{indexConstruction}.
